This portfolio has two pages for now:

- Project list page - That shows all the projects that I have done so far.
- Timeline page - Show the timeline or the path that I took to reach the position that I am in right now.

## Tech

The app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
